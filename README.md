Route-Nav
=========

Java implementation of a simple route navigation system that gets the distance of a route, the shortest routes between two points and all possible routes between two points 

How to run it ? 
==========
To run the test suite you can either :

1. Import the project into Eclipse as a Java project an run the class TestCase.

2. Using the command line, cd into the project root directory. Then cd into the "run-jar" directory and run the command "java -jar fabiocarballo-satnav.jar" . It should run the test suite and listing that all the tests went okay.

Thank you :)
